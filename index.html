    <h1>MY PROGRAMMING PORTFOLIO</h1>
   <div class="one">
    <p>
        Welcome to my programming portfolio. This is a portfolio showcasing some of my work.
        Here are some of my work.
      <ul>
          <li>
            <a href= "https://anzalmohamed.github.io/my-first-webpage1/">my first webpage</a>: This is a webpage I created on my first week of learning about coding and generally web development in Moringa School.
            I used Html and Css to create the webpage.
              
          </li> 
      </ul>
         Currently I have not created many websites or have a list of things I have personnally achieved because I am a student and very new to this world of programming. It is my dream though, to be the best programmer and developer out there one day and have accomplished alot in this field. I am interestred in developing applications that will help make our day to day lives easier and less cumbersome.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Anzal Mohamed. I completed my High School education in 2018 in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tVP1zc0zDAsSrawqCw3YLRSNagwtDBKSzZPNDNIM7NINje0tAIKmZinmSSbJqalmVikWSQle0mkZyTmZeYmKhSnJufnpSQWVSoUJ2fk5-cAAKHYGPI&q=ghanima+secondary+school&oq=ghanima&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j46i175i199j0l5.7394j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"a>Ghanima el marzuq girls secondary</a> 
      As for hobbies I can name probably alot write now my my main <a href="/home/anzal/Desktop/my-programming-portfolio/my-hobies.html">hobbies</a> are in that list.
      I have always had this goal of being a software engineer but somehow when I completed my high school education my parents pulled out the <strong>you will do medicine and <em>Nothing else!</em></strong> card on me.somehow I do not blame them as the fault kind of also is mine...see I had been singing that I want to be a neurosurgeon song to them since I could sing my ABC song in class one.
      all that changed when I took computer as a subject in high school and instantly started building castle in the air of being the next Elon Musk and here we are today... .After litrally convincing my parents for the last <span class="two"> two years </span> they let me finally take this course in <a href= "https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School.</a> My journey begins here.
